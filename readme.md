[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4057c1e9-f680-49d5-a1df-fae5bd2c157f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hope-vauxhall/deploys)

This is site is based on Infinity template (CC-BY-3.0 details below). Everything was a bit rushed to get things together, so corners have been cut and good practices ignored. Optimistically someone will go back and rebuild this / throw away and start again.

As this site doesn't seem to be going away it is in the process of roughly being migrated over to Eleventy + Tailwind with Netlify CMS behind it. Beware of the tech debt ahead.
