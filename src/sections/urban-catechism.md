You might be reading this and thinking, 'I want to know more about Jesus, the Bible or Christianity'. If that is you then one of the Hope Church Family would love to meet with you and do 'Urban Catechism'. The Urban Catechism is a great way to learn the amazing truths from the Bible through questions and answers. One of the reasons we love it at Hope is because it's been written specifically for people living on estates. 

If you would like to meet with someone to do this then please get in touch with us below:
