**Everyone is welcome on Sundays – you don’t need to be a ‘good’ or ‘churchy’ person and you don’t need to wear anything special.**

On Sundays we will always open the Bible and hear God speak to us through his word. We will talk a lot about Jesus – because we believe he is the real hope for Vauxhall. We will sing songs that praise God and we will talk to Him in prayer. We also learn amazing truths through rap! We love sharing food together and so we end our Sundays with a meal (apart from on the first Sunday of the month).

Our Sundays are family friendly and we have a children’s group for primary school age children during the service. We also have Spanish Translation for all our services.
