# Jesus

As a church we want to be all about Jesus. We believe that the whole of the Bible is about him, that he is the centre of all things, and that he is the hope of the world.

# The Message of Hope

Hope is not an idea or a desire, it is not wishful thinking or finger-crossing. Real hope is absolute confidence that what God has promised will come true because of Jesus. Hope is a person. Hope is Jesus. It is this message of hope that we want to proclaim.

# In the Heart of Vauxhall

We are passionate about Vauxhall. As we plant Hope Church in the heart of the place, we pray that the message of hope will be planted in the hearts of the people.
