Although we meet in a place, Hope Church is really a group of people - a family devoted to God, to each other and to Vauxhall.

Whatever your background and whatever your story, the good news about Jesus is the only thing that can bring real hope. Thatâ€™s why we love telling people about Jesus and keeping him central in everything we do.

We want Hope Church to be a place where people of all ages and from all backgrounds can come together and hear the life-changing, hope-bringing message of Jesus.

Come and join us.

**_You might be reading this and thinking, 'I want to know more about Jesus, the Bible or Christianity'. If that is you then one of the Hope Church Family would love to meet with you and do 'Urban Catechism'.
