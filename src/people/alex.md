Alex has been part of Hope Church since 2019 and now serves as both a member and our Community Deacon. In her deacon role, she helps ensure that our church family and wider community are cared for in practical and compassionate ways—especially when life feels difficult. Alex also co-leads our Doors Team alongside Harrison, supporting church members as they go out onto the Vauxhall Gardens Estate to share Jesus on the doorstep, offering both practical help and spiritual encouragement.
