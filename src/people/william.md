name: William
shortBio: William is one of the Elders at Hope Church Vauxhall. He joined the
  team with the hope of planting a church on a nearby housing estate, eagerly
  trusting God to open doors and grow the work. William grew up in Argentina, so
  he loves football (though supporting West Ham keeps his expectations low) and
  a good steak. He longs for people to experience the hope and peace that only
  Jesus brings. William is married to Roberta, and they have been blessed with
  two wonderful children
