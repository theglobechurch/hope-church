A 'catechism' is a way of teaching things through questions and answers. Christians have used catechisms for thousands of years. At Hope Church we use 'The Urban Catechism' to help people understand the Bible and Christian faith better. Particularly people who are looking into Christianity or who are new to the Christian faith. One of the reasons we love 'The Urban Catechism' is because it has been written by people living on estates for people living on estates.

If you would like to find out more about Christianity and what the Bible teaches someone from the Hope family would love to meet up and go through the Urban Catechism with you.
