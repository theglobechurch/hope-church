You and your pooch are invited to join us for "Bark! The Herald Angels Sing", a dog friendly Christmas Carol Service! This is a FREE event where we'll sing in the season and hear more about what Christmas is all about.

There will also be festive treats for people and pups and a prize for the pup that is the most merry and bright!
